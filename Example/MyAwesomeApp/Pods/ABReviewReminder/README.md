# ABReviewReminder
`ABReviewReminder` is a utility written in Swift 2.0 that reminds the iPhone and iPad app users (iOS 8.0 or later) to review your app. The code is released under the MIT, so feel free to modify and share your changes with the world. 

## Usage
The easiest way to start using `ABReviewReminder` is to start the session providing your appId provided by Apple (1), and calling ABReviewReminder.appLaunched() (2) at the end of your app delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method. 

```swift
ABReviewReminder.startSession("12345678") //1
ABReviewReminder.appLaunched() //2
```
### Configuration
`ABReviewReminder` provides:
	
1. [Options](#options) to configure the behavior.
2. [Strings](#strings) to customize the alert strings.
3. [Delegate methods](#delegate) for callbacks
4. [Custom actions](#actions) for adding your own custom actions to the alert.

```swift
// list of options to override the default behavior
let options:[ABReviewReminderOptions : AnyObject] =
[
    ABReviewReminderOptions.Debug: true,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.Delegate: self,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.DaysUntilPrompt: 1,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.UsesUntilPrompt: 10,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.TimeBeforeReminding: 2,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.AppVersionType: "CFBundleShortVersionString"
]

// list of string to provide costum strings for the alert
let strings:[ABAlertStrings : String] =
[
    ABAlertStrings.AlertTitle: "My custom alert title",
    ABAlertStrings.AlertMessage: "My custom alert message",
    ABAlertStrings.AlertDeclineTitle: "My custom decline button title",
    ABAlertStrings.AlertRateTitle: "My custom rate button title",
    ABAlertStrings.AlertRateLaterTitle: "My custom rate later button title"
]
        
ABReviewReminder.startSession("12345678", withOptions: options, strings: strings)
ABReviewReminder.appLaunched()
```
#### Options (`ABReviewReminderOptions`)<a name="options"></a>:
* `Debug: Bool` Default is `false` If set the alert will be shown every time the app starts.
WARNING: don't forget to set debug flag back to false when deploying to production.
* `Delegate: ABReviewReminderDelegate` Default is `nil` If set the ABReviewReminder events will be delegated.
* `DaysUntilPrompt: Int` Default is `30` The amount of days to wait to show the alert for a specific version of the app.
* `UsesUntilPrompt: Int` Default is `20`. If set the alert will be shown every time the app starts
An example of a 'use' would be if the user launched the app. 
Bringing the app into the foreground (on devices that support it) would also be considered a 'use'. You tell `ABReviewReminder` about these events using the two methods: ABReviewReminder.appLaunched() and when app triggers the UIApplicationWillEnterForegroundNotification event
Users need to 'use' the same version of the app this many times before before they will be prompted to rate it.
* `TimeBeforeReminding: Int` Default is `1` Once the rating alert is presented to the user, they might select 'Remind me later'. This value specifies how long (in days) `ABReviewReminder` will wait before reminding them.
* `AppVersionType: String` The app version type ABReviewReminder will track. Default the major version `CFBundleVersion`. Possible values: `["CFBundleVersion", "CFBundleShortVersionString"]`
* `UseMainBundle: Bool` Default is `false` If set to true, the main bundle will always be used to load localized strings. Set this to true if you have provided your own custom localizations in ABReviewReminderLocalizable.strings in your main bundle.  

#### Strings (`ABAlertStrings`)<a name="strings"></a>:
* `AlertTitle: String` This is the title of the message alert that users will see. 
* `AlertMessage: String` This is the message your users will see once they've passed the day+launches threshold.
* `AlertDeclineTitle: String` The text of the button that declines reviewing the app.
* `AlertRateTitle: String` Text of button that will send user to app review page.
* `AlertRateLaterTitle: String` Text for button to remind the user to review later. 

#### Custom actions<a name="actions"></a>:
`ABReviewReminder` provides class method `addAlertAction` to add you own costum action to the alert. `addAlertAction` does some health checks for the index were the action will be added. Note: The Reject action item will be always put at the end of the actions list. 

```swift
addAlertAction(action: UIAlertAction)
// OR
addAlertAction(action: UIAlertAction, atIndex index: Int)
```

```swift
let customAlertAction = UIAlertAction(title: "My Custom action", style: .Default, handler: {
    (alert: UIAlertAction!) -> Void in
    print("My Custom action button clicked.")
})
ABReviewReminder.startSession("12345678")
ABReviewReminder.addAlertAction(customAlertAction, atIndex: 1)
    
ABReviewReminder.appLaunched()
```

#### Delegate (`ABReviewReminderDelegate`)<a name="delegate"></a>:
* `optional func userDidOptToRate()` called when the use clicks on the rate app button.
* `optional func userDidDeclineToRate()` called when the use clicks on the decline rate app button.
* `optional func userDidOptToRemindLater()` called when the use clicks on the remind me later button.
* `optional func reachabilityChangedWithNetworkStatus(newNetworkStatus: String)` called when network status changes. Possible values of the newNetworkStatus are: `Offline|Online`



##Production examples:
Make sure you set `ABReviewReminderOptions.Debug: false` or remove it from the passed [options](#options) to ensure the request is not shown every time the app is launched. Also make sure that `ABReviewReminder.startSession` and `ABReviewReminder.appLaunched` functions are called in the `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.

This example states that the rating request is only shown when the app has been launched 5 times **and** after 7 days.

```swift
let options:[ABReviewReminderOptions : AnyObject] =
[
    ABReviewReminderOptions.Delegate: self,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.DaysUntilPrompt: 7,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.UsesUntilPrompt: 5,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.TimeBeforeReminding: 2
]

ABReviewReminder.startSession("12345678", withOptions: options)
ABReviewReminder.appLaunched()
```

If you wanted to show the request after 5 days only you can set the following:

```swift
let options:[ABReviewReminderOptions : AnyObject] =
[
    ABReviewReminderOptions.Delegate: self,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.DaysUntilPrompt: 5,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.UsesUntilPrompt: 0,
    ABReviewReminderOptions.TimeBeforeReminding: 2
]
ABReviewReminder.startSession("12345678", withOptions: options)
ABReviewReminder.appLaunched()
```
